# Random Quote App

> This project has an identical counterpart [here](https://github.com/MichaelFarquhar/random-quote-vue), built using Vue instead of React.

### Features
- Built with React and Typescript.
- Styled with [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/).
- Makes requests to the [Quotable Api](https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable) to retrieve random quotes.
- Gives the user an option to switch between 29 themes offered by daisyUI and saves the selection in local storage. This is done using the [theme-change](https://github.com/saadeghi/theme-change) library.
